Once there was a monkey and their best friend named "Chunky", 
they loved to play a lot.
But one day, a donkey appeared from the jungle, it was loud and obnoxious.
The monkey and "Chunky" asked the Donkey to leave. 
But the Donkey didn't leave, this frustrated The monkey and their friend "Chunky",
so they went to get some bananas, eventually, they found the most wonderful
bananas on at the top of the most beautiful of trees.
But there was a problem, the tree was too tall and too high for Monkey to climb 
or swing onto the branches to reach the Bananas, and it was too strong for Chunky 
to shake the bananas out of the tree.
But then the donkey appeared again, the donkey headbutted the tree, causing the
bananas to fall from the tree.
The monkey and "Chunky" thanked the Donkey, and the 3 of them became best friends.
End of story.
